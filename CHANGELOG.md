## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-28

### Added

  - Undo/Redo history (up to 128 states)
  - Import/Export `.clxsprite` asset files (JSON format with palette bank data)
  - One-click **Insert CoreLX Asset** generates tile hex data + palette setup code directly into the editor
  - Preview pane with packed 4bpp hex output and copy-to-clipboard
  - Location: `cmd/corelx_devkit/sprite_lab.go`
- **Project Templates** — Six built-in templates for new project creation

  - Accessible via **New** button in toolbar or **File > New Project** menu
  - Location: `cmd/corelx_devkit/templates.go`
- **IDE Menu Bar** — Traditional IDE menu structure (File, Edit, View, Build, Debug, Tools, Help)
  - Replaces ad-hoc menu; establishes professional SDK identity
  - Location: `cmd/corelx_devkit/help_center.go`
- **Three View Modes** — Split View, Emulator Focus, Code Only
  - Code Only mode hides the emulator entirely for focused editing
  - Dynamic layout construction prevents Fyne widget re-parenting issues
- **UI Density Modes** — Compact and Standard spacing via Tools menu
  - Custom Fyne theme with reduced padding, font sizes, and line spacing for Compact mode
  - Persisted in settings between sessions
  - Location: `cmd/corelx_devkit/compact_theme.go`
- **Autosave** — Automatic crash recovery for unsaved editor work
  - Location: `cmd/corelx_devkit/autosave.go`

### Changed
- **IDE Toolbar Redesign** — Domain-grouped toolbar (Project, Build, Run/Debug, View) with visual separators replacing flat button row
- **Terminology Update** — Project-centric language throughout (replaced ROM-centric phrasing); "Hardware Output" instead of "Emulator" in status labels
- **UI Compactness Overhaul** — Shortened toolbar labels, compacted panel headers, removed redundant controls, tightened spacing across all panels
- **Emulator No Longer Auto-Runs** — Emulator does not start running on project load; requires explicit Build + Run
- **Fullscreen Removed** — Replaced with maximize/restore toggle (F11) for more reliable window management on Linux
- **Documentation Update** — README, Programming Manual, Programming Guide, Hardware Features Status, V1 Charter, and V1 Acceptance all updated to reflect new IDE features and Sprite Lab

### Fixed
- **Sprite Lab Pixel Uniformity** — Dynamic cell-size computation ensures every sprite pixel maps to exactly the same number of screen pixels
- **Sprite Lab Paint Performance** — Only editor canvas re-renders during paint strokes; preview, hex dump, and palette updates deferred to stroke end
- **Sprite Lab Loading Lag** — Eliminated redundant initial image renders; placeholder images used until first `refreshVisuals` call
- **Sprite Lab Mouse Alignment** — Proportional coordinate mapping with `ImageFillStretch` and `NewCenter` constraint ensures correct cell targeting
- **Sprite Lab Grid Consistency** — Grid line thickness scales with cell size (2px for cells ≥16px, 1px for cells ≥4px) to prevent inconsistent appearance under display scaling
- **Split View Rendering** — Fixed Fyne widget re-parenting issue by dynamically building all layout containers in `setViewMode` instead of pre-building them
- **Window Maximize on Linux** — X11 `WM_NORMAL_HINTS` set programmatically to enable native WM maximize after Fyne/GLFW initialization

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Cycle-by-Cycle Debug Logger** - Comprehensive logging system that records CPU registers, PPU state (scanline, dot, VBlank flag, frame counter), APU state (all 4 channels), and key memory locations for each clock cycle
  - Command-line flags: `-cyclelog <file>`, `-maxcycles <N>`, `-cyclestart <N>`
  - UI toggle: Debug → Toggle Cycle Logging
  - Supports start cycle offset to skip initialization
  - Single file output with all state information
- **Register Viewer Panel** - Real-time CPU register display with:
  - All registers (R0-R7, PC, SP, PBR, DBR, Flags)
  - Scrollable display (fixes off-screen issue)
  - Copy All button for clipboard access
  - Save State button to save register state to timestamped file
  - Binary representation for registers
- **Memory Viewer Panel** - Hex dump viewer with:
  - Bank selector (0-255)
  - Offset selector (0x0000-0xFFFF)
  - 16 bytes per line display
  - ASCII representation
  - Real-time updates
- **PPU State Getters** - Added `GetScanline()` and `GetDot()` methods for debugging
- **OAM/PPU/APU Adapters** - Interface adapters to avoid import cycles in debug logger

### Fixed
- **MOV Mode 2 I/O Register Bug** (Critical) - Fixed sprite movement issue
  - **Problem**: Mode 2 was reading 16 bits from I/O registers (which are 8-bit only)
  - **Impact**: ROMs reading VBlank flag got 0x0100 instead of 0x0001, causing infinite wait loops
  - **Solution**: Automatic detection of I/O addresses (bank 0, offset >= 0x8000) - reads 8-bit and zero-extends to 16-bit
  - **Location**: `internal/cpu/instructions.go:30-49`
  - **Hardware Compatibility**: ✅ FPGA-implementable using standard address decoding logic
- **VBlank Flag Timing** - Improved flag persistence through entire VBlank period
  - Flag now correctly persists through scanlines 200-219
  - Fixed flag re-set logic to ensure it's available throughout VBlank

### Changed
- **MOV Mode 2 Behavior** - Now automatically detects I/O vs normal memory:
  - I/O registers: Reads 8-bit, zero-extends to 16-bit
  - Normal memory: Reads 16-bit as before
- **MOV Mode 3 Behavior** - Already had I/O detection, now consistent with Mode 2
- **Programming Manual** - Updated to document automatic I/O register detection
- **Documentation** - Consolidated and updated all documentation

### Documentation
- Updated `NITRO_CORE_DX_PROGRAMMING_MANUAL.md` to version 1.1
- Documented automatic I/O register detection in MOV instructions
- Updated `MASTER_PLAN.md` with current status
- Updated `README.md` with latest features
