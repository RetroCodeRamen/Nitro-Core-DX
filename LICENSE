License Philosophy (Non-Binding)

Nitro Core DX is intended to be a developer-friendly platform that encourages experimentation, creativity, and commercial software creation while preserving the integrity and long-term stewardship of the underlying system.

This license separates platform ownership from software ownership to ensure developers benefit directly from their work while allowing the platform to evolve responsibly, including future hardware implementations.
