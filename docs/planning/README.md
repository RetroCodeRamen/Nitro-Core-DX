# Planning Documents

This directory contains planning, roadmap, and implementation-plan documents.

## Current Planning Inputs

- `DEV_TOOLS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
  - Dev tools roadmap and implementation ideas (review against current code before executing)
- `FUTURE_FEATURES_PARKING_LOT.md`
  - Deferred ideas / future expansion concepts (keyboard bus, FM follow-ups, etc.)

## Historical / Mixed Snapshot Planning

- `MASTER_PLAN.md`
  - Consolidated historical planning + review document
  - Contains useful context but includes stale status sections
  - Treat as a planning archive, not present-state truth

## Usage Guidance

- For “what should we build next?” decisions, prefer:
  1. current test results + recent worklog
  2. `docs/CORELX_DATA_MODEL_PLAN.md` (for CoreLX/SDK work)
  3. targeted planning docs in this folder
