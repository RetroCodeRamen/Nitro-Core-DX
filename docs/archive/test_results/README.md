# Archived Test Results and Testing Snapshots

This folder contains historical testing plans, result summaries, and milestone-specific test-ROM diagnostics that were moved out of `docs/testing/` during documentation cleanup.

Use these files for historical/debugging context only.

For current testing workflows and commands, use:

- `docs/testing/README.md`
- `docs/testing/TEST_SUMMARY.md`
- `README.md` (testing command references / troubleshooting links)
