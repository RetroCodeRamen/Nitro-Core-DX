# Legacy Prebuilt ROMs

This folder contains older prebuilt `.rom` binaries that were moved out of `test/roms/` to reduce clutter.

Notes:
- Source files (`.corelx`) and ROM generators (`build_*.go`) remain in `test/roms/`.
- Most of these ROMs can be regenerated from the corresponding source/generator.
- Current active/manual diagnostics and commonly referenced ROMs remain at the top level of `test/roms/`.
